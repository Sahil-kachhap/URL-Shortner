# URL Shortener Server 🔗

A **minimal backend project** built with **Golang**, **Redis**, and **Docker** that demonstrates the core functionality of a URL shortener.  
It allows users to shorten long URLs, set expiry times, and includes **basic rate limiting** for fair usage.  
This project is lightweight and educational but can serve as a foundation for building a production-ready URL shortener.
